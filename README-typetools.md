This is a version of Guava that is annotated with type annotations for the Checker Framework.

The annotations are only in the main Guava project, not in the "Android" variant that supports JDK 7 and Android.


To build this project
---------------------

Optionally change `guava/pom.xml` to use a locally-built version of the Checker Framework.

To create file `guava/target/guava-HEAD-jre-SNAPSHOT.jar`:
(This takes about 25 minutes, because it performs pluggable type-checking.)

```
(cd guava && mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Danimal.sniffer.skip=true)
```

To use a locally-built Checker Framework, add `-P checkerframework-local`.


Typechecking
------------

Only the packages `com.google.common.primitives` and
`com.google.common.base` are annotated by Index Checker annotations.  In
order to get implicit annotations in class files, the Index Checker runs on
all files during compilation, but warnings are suppressed. The Index
Checker is run in another phase to typecheck just the two annotated
packages. If there are errors, then the build fails.

The Maven properties in guava/pom.xml can be used to change the behavior:

- `checkerframework.checkers` defines which checkers are run during compilation
- `checkerframework.suppress` defines warning keys suppressed during compilation
- `checkerframework.index.packages` defines packages checked by the Index Checker

- `checkerframework.extraargs` defines additional argument passed to the checkers during compilation, for example `-Ashowchecks`.
- `checkerframework.extraargs2` defines additional argument passed to the checkers during compilation, for example `-Aannotations`.
- `index.only.arg` defines additional argument passed to the Index Checker, for example `-Ashowchecks`.


Typechecking against the master branch of the Checker Framework
---------------------------------------------------------------

The released version of the Checker Framework may be incompatible with the
development version in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/tree/master .  For example,
the GitHub version may have renamed or added annotations or error messages.

When a pull request depends on forthcoming Checker Framework features, make
pull requests against a branch named `cf-master`.  Its Travis job uses the
Checker Framework from GitHub, rather than a Checker Framework release.

To create the `cf-master` branch if it does not exist:
It should differ only in file `.travis.yml`, which should pass
```
  "-P checkerframework-local"
```
(with the quotes) to `./.travis-build.sh`.

Whenever a Checker Framework release is made:
 * undo the change in `.travis.yml`,
 * update the Checker Framework version number,
 * pull-request the `cf-master` branch into `master`, and
 * delete the `cf-master` branch.


To update to a newer version of the upstream library
----------------------------------------------------

Check for a release at
  https://github.com/google/guava/releases
.  If there has been one since the last time this repository was pulled,
then follow the instructions at "To upload to Maven Central".

**After** doing that, you may run

```
git pull https://github.com/google/guava
```

and then re-build to ensure that typechecking still works.
Doing this `git pull` permits incremental resolution of merge conflicts,
but makes it difficult to re-release a given version of Guava.

If you wish to see a simplified diff between this fork of Guava and upstream (to make sure that you did not make any mistakes when resolving merge conflicts):

 * Clone both upstream and this fork.
 * Make a copy of each clone, because you will destructively edit each one.
 * Run the following commands in each temporary clone:
```
   rm -rf .git
   mvn -B clean
   preplace '^\@AnnotatedFor.*\n' ''
   preplace '^ *\@(Pure|Deterministic|SideEffectFree)\n' ''
   # preplace '^ *\@SuppressWarnings.*\n' ''
   preplace '^import org.checker.*\n' ''
   preplace '\@GTENegativeOne ' ''
   preplace '\@IndexFor\([^()]+\) ' ''
   preplace '\@IndexOr(Low|High)\([^()]+\) ' ''
   preplace '\@IntRange\([^()]+\) ' ''
   preplace '\@IntVal\([^()]+\) ' ''
   preplace '\@(|LT|LTEq)LengthOf\([^()]+\) ' ''
   preplace '\@MinLen\([^()]+\) ?' ''
   preplace '\@NonNegative ' ''
   preplace '\@NonNull ' ''
   preplace '\@Nullable ' ''
   preplace '\@PolyNull ' ''
   preplace '\@PolySigned ' ''
   preplace '\@Positive ' ''
   preplace '\@SameLen\("[^"]+"\) ' ''
   preplace '\@SignedPositive ' ''
   preplace '\@Unsigned ' ''
   preplace '\@UnknownSignedness ' ''
   preplace ' extends Object>' '>'
   preplace ' extends Object,' ','
   preplace ' \[\]' '[]'
   preplace ' \.\.\.' '...'
   preplace '; *// *\([0-9]+\)$' ';'
```
 * Diff the two temporary clones.


To upload to Maven Central
--------------------------

This must be done on a CSE machine, which has access to the necessary passwords.

If you want to re-release some version of Guava because you have added
annotations or because the Checker Framework has changed, then *you will
need to do something special*.  (Because you have probably pulled, from
upstream, commits subsequent to the release.)  Those instructions are not
yet written.

Use the latest Checker Framework release
(https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/releases) by changing
`pom.xml` (in 1 place) and `guava/pom.xml` (in 2 places).  Re-build to
ensure that typechecking still works.  Commit and push.  If a `cf-master`
branch exists in this repository, follow the instructions above to merge it
into master.

Pull in the latest Guava version (https://github.com/google/guava/releases):
```
git fetch --tags https://github.com/google/guava
git pull https://github.com/google/guava v28.2
```

Update the version number
 * multiple places in this file, and
 * in file guava/cfMavenCentral.xml .
If it's not the same as the upstream version, then also edit pom.xml and guava/pom.xml.
